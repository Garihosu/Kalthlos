# 00 - The Polar Borders

Before any humans existed, there were two mounds of fog on either ends of the earth where inside there were spirit-like entities called xi. They were confined within these borders, however they had magnificent powers, supernatural, and beyond human recognition. The xi speculated that they would be able to leave past this border to the world beyond if they had physical bodies. They tried many attempts at this, such as creating vessels and attempting to control them, which failed, or creating already sentient beings and possessing them. Every attempt failed. There was one that succeeded in creating them physical bodies, however they wouldn't be able to control them, being statue-like and still uncapable of leaving past the fog.

The aftermath of these experiments was having a population of rapidly-growing, intelligent, sentient creatures. These were humans. As their creation, the xi allowed the humans to stay on the borders where there was surplus food and resources for them. The xi created large temples where their physical forms would live. Very quickly, they noticed, the humans' population grew at a tremendous rate, therefore they ordered most of them to leave the poles, spare a few chosen.

The large surplus left, however even the few chosen grew fast. They took a portion from these, disposed of the rest, and sent them to an island strip southeast of the main continent. The cultures, due to isolation, of the islanders and the surplus on the main continent were significantly different.

Explained in the rest of this age will be the different cultures of the main continent (called Kalthlos) and the island chain (called the nine islands).
