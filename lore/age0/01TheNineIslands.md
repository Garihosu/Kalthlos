# 01 - The Nine Islands

The Nine Islands is a chain of islands where a chosen few was placed after the Poles became too populated with humans. Here, the few placed here diverged immediately in culture from the other humans that had left before them.

These people lived in a fairly nomadic lifestyle. They built small huts where their families would live, about one hut per family. They created their own religion, taking note of the diverse species of bird that populated the island. There were nine bird-gods: Rasi, Horo, Nalu, Mayu, Taya, Rola, Wenu, Kala, and Mene.

Here is a description of each:

- **Rasi, god of land.**
- **Horo, god of life.**
- **Nalu, god of water.**
- **Mayu, god of fish.**
- **Taya, god of dreams.**
- **Rola, god of plants.**
- **Wenu, god of knowledge.**
- **Kala, god of death.**
- **Mene, god of fire.**

It is *merely* a coincidence that there are *nine* islands, *nine* gods, and soon to be *nine* cultural divisions.

The only creatures present on the islands other than humans were birds, fish, and insects. As such, the islanders' diet mainly consisted of fish, plants, and a rare bird they called a kumaye. It is a large, aggressive bird that they value as a feastful meal. This is, in fact, the only bird that they eat as they believe all others are sacred. It is also one of the only birds that cannot fly, however it is fairly strong and able to attack a human. Male humans often demonstrated their superiority by fighting them.

There were human scholars who devised a small writing system. It is syllabic, as there are only so few sounds in their language, namely `a`, `e`, `h`, `i`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `w`, and y. `o` and `u` were treated as extensions of the same sound, therefore the difference wasn't often marked. This would create up to 41 glyphs (removing the non-existant yi, wo, and wu sounds). `o` and `u` were slowly merging to simply `u`, while `e` and `i` were also slowly merging to `i`, however no special marking was used.

The humans built special temples in order to worsip their gods, and the scholars were used as priests. Soon, the priests discovered a supernatural power called *ether*, which they thought was a supernatural power given by the gods. They were only capable of conjuring simple elements, and they could only do it with intense focus with their prayers. Read `concepts/ether.md` for more information about ether.

This all happened before what would be known as the first Kalthlonion age.
