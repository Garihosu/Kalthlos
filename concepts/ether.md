# Ether

Ether is a mystical substance that can be used by humanoids as a sort of magic-like power. Unlike mana, ether is used from outside the user's body and is weaved to create magic. Ether is very high in energy, which is why it is so capable of being molded by hands.

Sometimes humans may unintentionally cast ether, such as through religious activity (as seen with the islanders) or by intense emotion. It is unknown why this happens, especially since it is only with humans, typically a non-magic race.

There are three major ether-weaving forms. A weaving form is a collection of techniques that is taught by a master of the technique, such as a priest or a wizard.

1. Kalthlonian weaving
2. Ninefold weaving
3. Danakin weaving

## Kalthlanion Weaving

The weaving form used by the few Kalthlonians that learn it, which is a very few amount considering how difficult the form is. It has a *very* large amount of techniques, probably close to two-hundred.

Kalthlonian weaving is very lightweight in ether, therefore to use a technique, it doesn't require much ether. Even so, in order to maintain this little usage, it requires great expertise, as the techniques are significantly powerful.

It uses very specific hand symbols in order to channel the correct forms of ether, as well as spoken words, taken from old Kalthlonian that represent the techniques weaved. Some fairly skilled users can use it without the vocations, or even without the hand signs as well.

This form of weaving was known as the "original form," other than Ninefold Weaving, one of the oldest forms widely used.

## Ninefold Weaving

Ninefold Weaving, rather than being divided by techniques, is divided by rank. There are nine ranks, where there is a fairly transparent line of how one is to form and cast the ether. The nine ranks are representative of the nine gods, and their respective elements. Ninefold weaving is often invoked by prayers, however it is possible to do so without.

The elements are:

1. Land
2. Life
3. Water
4. Fish
5. Dream
6. Plant
7. Knowledge
8. Death
9. Fire

#### Land

Manipulates or creates land.

#### Life

Heals or revives people or animals.

#### Water

Conjures or manipulates water.

#### Fish

Allows for water breathing or the summoning of fish.

#### Dream

Allows to tap in to dreams, create dreams, or cause a dream to be reality.

#### Plant

Conjures or manipulates plants.

#### Knowledge

Communicates telepathically with other humanoids, or reads minds.

#### Death

A very dangerous magic that inflicts instant pain or death.

#### Fire

Conjures or manipulates fire.

## Danakin Weaving

A form used by danakai that specialize or learn ether magic. It contains aspects of both Ninefold Weaving and Kalthlonion weaving, in that it is resourceful like Kalthlonion Weaving and simple like Ninefold. There are 5 forms of Danakin Weaving, matching up with the forms of danakin mana conjuration.

1. Gunmanku, Force
2. Haemanku, Energy
3. Hamanku, Life
4. Jaromanku, Death
5. Tamanku, Danakh

#### Gunmanku

The manipulation of the physical world, one of the easiest to use.

#### Haemanku

The cycling of mana or ether, used mostly to quickly replenish mana in desperate times.

#### Hamanku

Healing and restoration; more powerful than that of Ninefold but harder to use. Distinguished by the light pink glow of the eyes with the symbol for "hae."

#### Jaromanku

Instant death, necromancy, and infliction of pain. Distinguished by the orange glowing of the eyes with the symbol for "jaro."

#### Tamanku

A secret weaving form in which only danakai use. It has very special magic that is very strong, yet difficult to the point where only danakai can use it.
